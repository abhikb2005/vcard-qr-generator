## 1. r/SideProject

**Title:** I built a free vCard QR code generator — no signup, no tracking, runs entirely in your browser

**Body:**

Hey everyone! I wanted to share a side project I've been working on.

**What it does:** You enter your contact info (name, phone, email, company, etc.) and it generates a vCard QR code that people can scan to instantly save your contact. Everything runs client-side in the browser — no data is sent to a server.

**Why I built it:** I was frustrated that every QR code tool out there either requires an account, watermarks the output, or tracks your data. I wanted something that just works.

**Features:**
- 100% free, no signup required
- Works offline (all processing happens in your browser)
- Download as PNG
- Pro option for custom colors, logos, SVG export, and frames
- Bulk generator for teams (upload a spreadsheet, get QR codes for everyone)

**Tech stack:** Plain HTML/JS, hosted on Cloudflare Pages. No frameworks on the frontend.

Would love any feedback! Here's the link: [vcardqrcodegenerator.com](https://www.vcardqrcodegenerator.com/)

## 2. r/InternetIsBeautiful

**Title:** A free tool that turns your contact info into a scannable QR code — no account needed, works entirely in your browser

**Body:**

I made a simple web tool where you enter your contact details and get a vCard QR code. When someone scans it with their phone camera, your full contact info pops up and they can save it in one tap.

It's completely free, no account needed, and nothing is stored on a server — all the QR generation happens in your browser.

Useful for business cards, conference badges, email signatures, or even your resume.

## 3. r/Entrepreneur

**Title:** Free tool I built that's been saving me (and my clients) money on networking — vCard QR codes

**Body:**

Quick share for anyone who uses business cards or does a lot of networking:

I built a free vCard QR code generator at [vcardqrcodegenerator.com](https://www.vcardqrcodegenerator.com/). You enter your contact info once, download the QR code, and put it on your business card, email signature, flyer, or even your phone lock screen.

When someone scans it, your full contact details (name, phone, email, company, title, website, address) pop up and they save it in one tap. No more manually typing in phone numbers or losing paper cards.

**Why it matters for entrepreneurs:**
- You never lose a lead because someone misplaced your card
- Your contact info is always up-to-date (just reprint the QR if anything changes)
- It makes a professional impression at networking events
- The bulk generator lets you create QR codes for your whole team from a spreadsheet

It's free to use, no account required. Happy to answer any questions about how other businesses are using it.

## 4. r/freelance

**Title:** Tip: Add a vCard QR code to your invoices, proposals, and email signature — here's a free tool to make one

**Body:**

Small tip that's worked well for me: I added a vCard QR code to my invoice footer, proposal documents, and email signature. When a client or prospect scans it, my full contact info saves directly to their phone.

It's a small touch, but it makes you look professional and makes it effortless for clients to call or email you. No more "hey, can you send me your phone number again?" messages.

I built a free tool to generate these: [vcardqrcodegenerator.com](https://www.vcardqrcodegenerator.com/)

No signup, no watermarks, runs in your browser. You fill in your details, download the QR code as a PNG, and drop it wherever you want.

The vCard format includes: name, phone, email, website, company, title, and address — so everything a client needs is in one scan.

Has anyone else been using QR codes in their freelance workflow? Curious how others are using them.

## 5. r/realtors

**Title:** Free tool to create QR codes for your business card — clients scan it and your contact saves instantly

**Body:**

Hey fellow agents — wanted to share a tool I came across that's been really useful for open houses and networking events.

It's a free vCard QR code generator: [vcardqrcodegenerator.com](https://www.vcardqrcodegenerator.com/)

You enter your contact info (name, brokerage, phone, email, website) and it generates a QR code. When someone scans it with their phone camera, your full contact card pops up and they can save it in one tap.

**Where I've seen agents use it:**
- On the back of business cards
- On open house sign-in sheets (scan to save my info)
- In listing flyers and brochures
- In email signatures
- On yard signs (some agents print a small QR alongside the phone number)

It's free, no account needed, and you can download the QR code as an image. There's also a bulk option if your brokerage wants to create QR codes for the whole office from a spreadsheet.

Anyone else using QR codes in their business? Would love to hear what's working.

## 6. r/sales

**Title:** Added a vCard QR code to my email signature — prospects actually save my contact info now

**Body:**

Simple workflow improvement I wanted to share:

I added a small QR code to my email signature that, when scanned, instantly saves my full contact details to the recipient's phone. Name, direct line, email, company, title — everything.

The result: when I follow up by phone, my name actually shows up on their caller ID instead of "Unknown Number." Small thing, but it's made a noticeable difference in pickup rates.

I used this free tool to generate it: [vcardqrcodegenerator.com](https://www.vcardqrcodegenerator.com/)

No signup, no tracking, just fill in your details and download the QR code as a PNG. Drop it into your email signature, business card, or LinkedIn banner.

If you manage a team, there's also a bulk generator where you upload a spreadsheet and get individual QR codes for everyone.

Has anyone else been doing this? Curious what other small signature tweaks have moved the needle for you.
