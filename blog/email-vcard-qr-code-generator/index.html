    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
      <p>Every email you send is a networking opportunity, yet most signatures only offer plain text contact details that recipients must manually type into their phones. A vCard QR code changes that instantly. By embedding a scannable code in your email signature—or attaching it to PDFs, proposals, and invoices—you give recipients a one-tap path to saving your complete contact information. No typos, no missed digits, just seamless connection building that works whether your email is read on a laptop, tablet, or smartphone.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- What Is an Email vCard QR Code? -->
    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">What Is an Email vCard QR Code?</h2>
      <p>A vCard QR code encodes your contact details—name, phone numbers, email addresses, company, job title, and website—into a small square image that any smartphone camera can read. When someone scans the code, their device prompts them to add you directly to their contacts app. Unlike a traditional signature block where recipients must copy-paste or retype your information, the QR code automates the entire process. Embedding this code in your email signature means every message you send carries a portable, error-free business card that works across all platforms and devices.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Benefits of Adding QR to Email Signatures -->
    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">Benefits of Adding QR to Email Signatures</h2>
      <p><strong>One-click contact saving:</strong> Recipients scan once and your complete details—including multiple phone numbers, social profiles, and your company address—appear in their contacts app ready to save. No manual entry means no transcription errors.</p>
      <p><strong>Professional impression:</strong> A QR code signals that you embrace modern technology and value your recipients' time. It differentiates your signature from the cluttered text blocks most professionals still use.</p>
      <p><strong>Works when forwarded:</strong> Email chains travel far. When your message gets forwarded to a new prospect or partner, your embedded QR code travels with it. New readers can save your contact details even if they weren't the original recipient—extending your networking reach organically.</p>
      <p><strong>Universal compatibility:</strong> Modern smartphones running iOS or Android read QR codes natively through the camera app. There's no special software to install, which removes friction from the contact-saving process.</p>

    <!-- How to Create Your Email Signature QR Code -->
    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">How to Create Your Email Signature QR Code</h2>
      <p>Follow these steps to generate a professional vCard QR code optimized for email:</p>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 pl-2">
        <li><strong>Visit the <a href="/" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline">free vCard QR Code Generator</a></strong> and enter your details: full name, job title, company, phone numbers, email addresses, and website.</li>
        <li><strong>Add optional fields</strong> like your physical address or LinkedIn profile URL to create a comprehensive digital business card.</li>
        <li><strong>Click Generate</strong> to create your QR code instantly. The tool runs entirely in your browser, so your data stays private.</li>
        <li><strong>Download the PNG</strong> at a resolution suitable for email (100-150 pixels wide works well for most signature layouts).</li>
        <li><strong>Insert the image into your email client's signature settings.</strong> In Gmail, Outlook, or Apple Mail, navigate to signature preferences and add the image alongside your text details.</li>
        <li><strong>Test thoroughly</strong> by sending yourself a test email and scanning the code with both iPhone and Android devices to confirm it imports correctly.</li>
      </ol>

    <!-- Best Size and Format for Email -->
    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">Best Size and Format for Email</h2>
      <p><strong>Recommended dimensions:</strong> Keep your QR code between 100 and 150 pixels wide for email signatures. This size balances scanability with signature aesthetics—large enough for cameras to read reliably, compact enough not to dominate your sign-off.</p>
      <p><strong>File format:</strong> Always use PNG. It preserves sharp edges, supports transparency if you want the code to blend with colored backgrounds, and doesn't introduce compression artifacts that could interfere with scanning.</p>
      <p><strong>Alt text:</strong> Add descriptive alt text like "Scan to save my contact details" so recipients with images disabled understand what they're missing. This also improves accessibility for screen reader users.</p>
      <p><strong>Quiet zone:</strong> Ensure the QR code has adequate white space around it. Most generators include this automatically, but if you crop the image, preserve at least a one-module border.</p>

    <!-- Where Else to Use Email vCard QR Codes -->
    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">Where Else to Use Email vCard QR Codes</h2>
      <p>Your email signature is just the starting point. The same QR code works beautifully in:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
        <li><strong>PDF proposals and contracts:</strong> Add the code to your letterhead or signature block so clients can save your details while reviewing documents.</li>
        <li><strong>Invoices:</strong> Make it easy for accounts payable contacts to reach you with questions.</li>
        <li><strong>Newsletters:</strong> Include a QR code in your email newsletter footer to help new subscribers save your contact for future reference.</li>
        <li><strong>Presentation slides:</strong> Add a QR code to your closing slide so attendees can connect with you after webinars or virtual meetings.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Troubleshooting Email QR Codes -->
    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">Troubleshooting Email QR Codes</h2>
      <p><strong>Images blocked by default:</strong> Many email clients hide images until the recipient clicks "Display images" or adds you to their contacts. Include clear alt text and consider adding a text fallback like "(Scan to save contact)" near the code.</p>
      <p><strong>QR code too small:</strong> If recipients report scanning difficulties, increase the image size to at least 120 pixels. Test in different email clients, as some compress images during rendering.</p>
      <p><strong>Broken or outdated information:</strong> If your phone number or email changes, you'll need to generate a new QR code and update your signature. Unlike dynamic QR codes, static vCard codes can't be edited after creation.
