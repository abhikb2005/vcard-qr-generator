    <!-- Why Include Email in Your vCard QR Code -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why Include Email in Your vCard QR Code?</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Email remains the backbone of professional communication. Including your email address in your <a href="/blog/vcard-qr-code/" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline">vCard QR code</a> ensures contacts can reach you through the channel most professionals prefer for business discussions:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Preferred for follow-up</strong> — Most business conversations continue via email after initial meetings</li>
        <li><strong>Reduces friction</strong> — Contacts tap your email to start composing immediately</li>
        <li><strong>Eliminates typos</strong> — Digital transfer prevents the errors that come from dictating email addresses</li>
        <li><strong>Complete contact record</strong> — Email, phone, and name save together as one organized contact</li>
        <li><strong>Professional appearance</strong> — Domain-based emails (you@company.com) reinforce your business identity</li>
        <li><strong>Asynchronous convenience</strong> — Recipients can email you later without scheduling a call</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Studies show that email is the most-used feature in saved contacts after phone numbers. Including it in your QR code makes follow-up seamless.</p>

    <!-- Choosing the Right Email Address -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Choosing the Right Email Address</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">The email you include affects how recipients perceive you professionally:</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Professional Domain Email (Recommended)</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Use an email on your company domain: <strong>sarah@acmecorp.com</strong> or <strong>contact@sarahdesigns.com</strong>. This reinforces your professional identity and builds trust.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Free Email Services</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Gmail, Outlook, and similar services are acceptable for freelancers and solopreneurs, but consider these tips:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>Use your actual name: <strong>sarah.johnson@gmail.com</strong>, not <strong>sj_designs_2023@gmail.com</strong></li>
        <li>Avoid numbers and underscores when possible</li>
        <li>Keep it professional—avoid casual or humorous addresses</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">When to Use Different Emails</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Business networking</strong> — Your primary professional email</li>
        <li><strong>Sales and marketing events</strong> — A dedicated leads email you monitor closely</li>
        <li><strong>Conference speaking</strong> — A speaking inquiries email if you receive many requests</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-4">Create different QR codes for different contexts—our generator is free and instant, so multiple versions cost nothing.</p>

    <!-- Email Formatting Tips -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Email Formatting Tips for QR Codes</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Follow these guidelines for best results:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Use lowercase</strong> — While email is technically case-insensitive, lowercase looks cleaner: <strong>john@example.com</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Double-check spelling</strong> — A typo means lost contacts; verify before generating</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid special characters</strong> — Stick to letters, numbers, periods, and hyphens</li>
        <li><strong>Keep it short</strong> — Long emails increase QR code density; brevity helps scannability</li>
        <li><strong>Test the saved contact</strong> — After scanning, tap the email to ensure it opens correctly in mail apps</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Email Privacy Considerations -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Email Privacy Considerations</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Your email address in a QR code is visible to anyone who scans it. Consider these privacy factors:</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Generator Privacy</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Our vCard QR code generator runs entirely in your browser. Your email address is never transmitted to or stored on any server—it stays private on your device.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">QR Code Sharing</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Once you share your QR code (on business cards, online, etc.), anyone who scans it can see your email. This is by design—but consider:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>Use a business email rather than personal for public cards</li>
        <li>Consider a dedicated networking email if spam is a concern</li>
        <li>Create separate QR codes for public vs. private contexts</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Making Email Follow-Up Easy -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Making Email Follow-Up Easy for Recipients</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">When someone scans your QR code and saves your contact, they can tap your email to start a new message with your address pre-filled. Make this even easier:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Include context in your job title</strong> — "Marketing Consultant - Tech Startups" helps them reference the conversation</li>
        <li><strong>Use notes field if available</strong> — Add "Met at TechConf 2025" so they remember the context</li>
        <li><strong>Follow up first</strong> — Scan their contact too, and send the first email to start the thread</li>
        <li><strong>Respond promptly</strong> — Quick replies reinforce the positive impression from your meeting</li>
      </ul>
