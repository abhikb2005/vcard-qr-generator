    <!-- Intro -->
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">A vCard QR code is a scannable barcode that instantly shares your professional contact information with anyone who points their smartphone camera at it. Instead of fumbling with paper business cards or manually typing phone numbers, recipients simply scan and save your details directly to their address book. Whether you're a sales professional, freelancer, real estate agent, or job seeker, a vCard QR code streamlines networking and ensures your contact information is always accurate and accessible.</p>

    <!-- What Is a vCard QR Code? -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">What Is a vCard QR Code?</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">A vCard QR code is a two-dimensional barcode that encodes contact information in the standard vCard format (also known as VCF). When someone scans this code with their phone's camera or a QR reader app, the device decodes the embedded data and prompts them to save the contact.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">The vCard format supports a wide range of information including your full name, multiple phone numbers, email addresses, company name, job title, website URL, and physical address. All of this data gets compressed into the QR pattern, creating a self-contained digital business card that works offline and never expires.</p>
      <p>Unlike dynamic QR codes that redirect to a web page, static vCard QR codes embed all information directly. This means they work without an internet connection and continue functioning indefinitely—perfect for printed materials that may be used months or years later.</p>

    <!-- Who Should Use vCard QR Codes -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Who Should Use vCard QR Codes</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">vCard QR codes benefit anyone who regularly shares contact information. Here are the professionals who gain the most value:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Networking professionals:</strong> Conference attendees, chamber of commerce members, and BNI group participants can exchange contact details in seconds rather than juggling stacks of paper cards.</li>
        <li><strong>Sales representatives:</strong> Field sales teams add QR codes to proposals, brochures, and presentation slides so prospects can save contact info without interrupting the conversation.</li>
        <li><strong>Real estate agents:</strong> Yard signs, flyers, and open house materials with QR codes let potential buyers reach you instantly while the property is fresh in their minds.</li>
        <li><strong>Freelancers and consultants:</strong> Include a vCard QR code on invoices, portfolios, and project deliverables to make follow-up effortless for clients.</li>
        <li><strong>Event speakers and exhibitors:</strong> Trade show booths and conference name badges with QR codes capture leads without requiring badge scanners or manual data entry.</li>
        <li><strong>Job seekers:</strong> Add a QR code to your printed resume or portfolio to ensure recruiters have your current phone number and LinkedIn profile.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Essentially, if you hand out business cards or share your contact information regularly, a vCard QR code saves time for both you and your contacts.</p>

    <!-- How to Create Your vCard QR Code -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">How to Create Your vCard QR Code</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Creating a professional vCard QR code takes just a few minutes with our <a href="/" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline">free generator tool</a>. Follow these steps:</p>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Open the generator:</strong> Navigate to our home page where the vCard QR code generator loads instantly in your browser.</li>
        <li><strong>Enter your contact details:</strong> Fill in your name, phone number, email address, company, job title, and any other information you want to share. Only include details you're comfortable making public.</li>
        <li><strong>Preview your vCard:</strong> Review the information to ensure accuracy. Typos in phone numbers or email addresses make your QR code useless.</li>
        <li><strong>Generate the QR code:</strong> Click the Generate button. The tool creates your unique QR code pattern instantly, right in your browser.</li>
        <li><strong>Test before downloading:</strong> Use your own phone to scan the preview and verify all fields appear correctly in the contact card.</li>
        <li><strong>Download the image:</strong> Save the PNG file to your device. For print materials, choose the highest resolution available.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional branding:</strong> Want to add your company logo? Our <a href="/logo-qr-code.html" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline">Pro generator</a> lets you embed a custom image in the center of your QR code.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The entire process happens locally in your browser—your contact information never gets uploaded to any server, ensuring complete privacy.</p>

    <!-- Design & Placement Best Practices -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Design & Placement Best Practices</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">A well-designed QR code scans reliably every time. Follow these <a href="/blog/vcard-qr-code-best-practices/" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline">best practices</a> to maximize success:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Maintain high contrast:</strong> Dark modules on a light background work best. Black on white is ideal, but dark blue or green on white also scan well. Avoid light colors or low-contrast combinations.</li>
        <li><strong>Preserve the quiet zone:</strong> Keep a white border around the QR code equal to at least 4 modules wide. This margin helps scanners detect the code boundaries.</li>
        <li><strong>Size appropriately:</strong> Print at minimum 2cm × 2cm (about 0.8 inches). For scanning from a distance—like on a poster or banner—increase the size proportionally. A 30cm viewing distance requires about 3cm codes.</li>
        <li><strong>Use vector formats when possible:</strong> SVG files scale without losing quality, making them ideal for professional printing.</li>
        <li><strong>Test on multiple devices:</strong> Scan with both iOS and Android phones before finalizing. Older devices may struggle with complex or small codes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-4">Strategic placement increases scans. Consider adding your vCard QR code to:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
        <li>Business cards (back side works great)</li>
        <li>Email signatures</li>
        <li>Resume headers</li>
        <li>Trade show banners and booth displays</li>
        <li>Product packaging and brochures</li>
        <li>Office door signs and name plates</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Common Problems & Quick Fixes -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Common Problems & Quick Fixes</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">If your QR code isn't working as expected, try these troubleshooting steps:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Code won't scan:</strong> Check the contrast and quiet zone. Increase the size if the code is too small or densely packed with data.</li>
        <li><strong>Contact saves with wrong encoding:</strong> Special characters in names or addresses sometimes cause issues. Stick to standard ASCII characters when possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Phone number not clickable:</strong> Ensure you're using the correct phone field format. Include country codes for international contacts.</li>
        <li><strong>Image appears blurry when printed:</strong> Export at 300 DPI or higher. Avoid resizing the image in Word or design software—scale proportionally only.</li>
        <li><strong>Code works on iPhone but not Android (or vice versa):</strong> Some older Android devices require a dedicated QR reader app. Test broadly before mass printing.</li>
        <li><strong>Too much data causes scanning failures:</strong> vCard QR codes have data limits. If you're including extensive information, prioritize essential fields and consider linking to a full profile page instead.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Privacy Considerations -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Privacy Considerations</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Before creating your vCard QR code, consider what information you're comfortable sharing publicly. Once printed, anyone who scans the code gains access to the embedded data.</p>
      <p class="mb-4"><strong>Recommendations for privacy-conscious users:</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
        <li>Use a work phone number rather than personal mobile if possible</li>
        <li>Consider a professional email address instead of personal accounts</li>
        <li>Omit your home address—office address or city/state is usually sufficient</li>
        <li>Create different QR codes for different contexts (networking events vs. public marketing materials)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-4">Our generator processes everything locally in your browser. Your contact information never touches our servers, so you maintain complete control over your data.</p>
