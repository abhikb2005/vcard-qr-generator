    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Creating a vCard QR code takes just seconds, but creating one that works flawlessly in every situation requires following proven best practices. A poorly designed QR code can frustrate potential contacts, damage your professional image, and waste valuable networking opportunities. Whether you're printing codes on business cards, adding them to email signatures, or displaying them at trade shows, the difference between a good QR code and a great one comes down to attention to detail. This guide covers everything you need to know about design, content, placement, testing, and printing to ensure your vCard QR code delivers a seamless experience for everyone who scans it.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Design Best Practices -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Design Best Practices</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">The visual design of your vCard QR code directly impacts its scannability. Start with size: your QR code should be at least 2cm x 2cm (approximately 0.8 inches square) for reliable scanning. Smaller codes work only in controlled conditions with high-quality cameras.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Maintain a clear quiet zone—the blank space surrounding your code—of at least 4 modules wide. This margin helps smartphone cameras distinguish the code from nearby graphics or text. Never let design elements encroach on this space.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Contrast is critical. The classic black-on-white combination offers the best scan rates, but you can use dark colors on light backgrounds if you maintain at least 70% contrast. Avoid gradients, patterns, or low-contrast color combinations that confuse scanners. If you want to <a href="/blog/customize-qr-codes/" class="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-800 underline">customize your QR code</a> with colors or logos, test thoroughly before printing.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Content Best Practices -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Content Best Practices</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">What you include in your vCard matters as much as how you design it. Focus on essential professional information: full name, job title, company name, professional email address, and phone number. Adding your LinkedIn profile or company website provides value without cluttering the contact.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Format phone numbers with the country code (e.g., +1 for US) to ensure international contacts can reach you. Use your professional email address rather than personal accounts—this maintains boundaries and presents a polished image.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Avoid including sensitive information like home addresses or personal mobile numbers unless specifically needed. Remember that QR codes can be scanned by anyone, so only include details you're comfortable sharing publicly. For a complete guide on what to include, read our <a href="/blog/qr-code-and-vcard-guide/" class="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-800 underline">vCard QR code guide</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Placement Best Practices -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Placement Best Practices</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Strategic placement maximizes the value of your vCard QR code. Business cards remain the most popular location—position the code on the back or in a corner that doesn't compete with essential text. Email signatures work well for digital networking, allowing recipients to save your contact with one scan.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">For physical displays like trade show booths, posters, or presentations, place QR codes at eye level where they're naturally visible and accessible. Consider the scanning distance: codes meant to be scanned from further away need to be proportionally larger.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Your website's contact page is another excellent location. A QR code lets mobile visitors save your details instantly without typing. Always include a brief call-to-action near the code, such as "Scan to save my contact."</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Testing Best Practices -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Testing Best Practices</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Never print or publish a vCard QR code without thorough testing. Test on both iOS and Android devices, as camera apps handle QR codes differently. Use at least two or three different scanning apps to ensure broad compatibility.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Test in various lighting conditions: bright sunlight, dim indoor lighting, and fluorescent office lights all affect camera performance differently. If your code works in challenging conditions during testing, it will perform reliably in the real world.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Verify that all contact fields import correctly. Check that phone numbers include the correct country code and that email addresses are properly formatted. A single character error can render your contact information useless.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Printing Best Practices -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Printing Best Practices</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Print quality can make or break your QR code's functionality. Export your code at a minimum of 300 DPI for crisp edges that scan reliably. PNG format preserves the sharpness better than JPEG, which can introduce compression artifacts.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Choose matte paper finishes over glossy when possible. Glossy surfaces create reflections that interfere with scanning, especially under bright lights. If you must use glossy materials, test the printed code under typical lighting conditions.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Always proof printed materials before committing to a full run. Print a single test copy and scan it with multiple devices.
