    <!-- Why Best Practices Matter -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why Best Practices Matter for vCard QR Codes</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">A vCard QR code that fails to scan wastes your networking opportunity. Someone interested enough to scan your code is a warm lead—you don't want technical issues getting in the way. Following vCard QR code best practices ensures your code scans reliably on every device, in any lighting, and from reasonable distances.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Poor design choices create real problems: low contrast makes codes invisible to cameras, insufficient quiet zones confuse scanners, and tiny sizes require awkward close-up scanning. Information overload creates dense codes that older phones struggle to read.</p>
      <p>The good news is that these issues are entirely preventable. By following the design, content, placement, and testing practices below, you'll create vCard QR codes that work the first time, every time.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Design Best Practices -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Design Best Practices</h2>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Maintain High Contrast</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">QR code scanners work by detecting the difference between light and dark areas. Dark modules on a light background provide the clearest signal. Black on white offers maximum contrast, but dark blue, dark green, or dark purple also work well. Avoid low-contrast combinations like yellow on white, light gray on white, or pastel colors that look similar in value.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Keep the Quiet Zone</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">The quiet zone is the blank space surrounding your QR code. This buffer helps scanners identify where the code begins and ends. Leave at least 4 modules of white space on all sides—roughly 2-3mm in most print applications. Crowding text, images, or decorative elements right up to the edge causes scan failures.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Size for Scanning Distance</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">The scanning distance determines minimum size. For business cards held at arm's length (30-50cm), 2-3cm works well. For conference badges scanned at similar distances, the same applies. For posters or signage viewed from 1-2 meters, increase to at least 4-5cm. The rule of thumb: divide the maximum scanning distance by 10 to get the minimum code width.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Color Considerations</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">If you want to match brand colors, keep modules dark and backgrounds light. Aim for at least 70% contrast between them. Avoid inverting the pattern (light modules on dark background), as some older scanners struggle with inverted codes. Never use gradients across the code—they create areas of insufficient contrast.</p>

    <!-- Content Best Practices -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Content Best Practices</h2>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">What to Include</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Focus on essential contact information that people actually use:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Full name</strong> — How you want to appear in their contacts</li>
        <li><strong>Primary phone number</strong> — One number with country code</li>
        <li><strong>Professional email</strong> — Your main business email</li>
        <li><strong>Company and title</strong> — Context for who you are</li>
        <li><strong>Website</strong> — Portfolio, LinkedIn, or company site</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">What to Avoid</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">More data creates denser codes that are harder to scan:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
        <li>Multiple phone numbers (pick the primary one)</li>
        <li>Home or personal addresses (use office address if needed)</li>
        <li>Long notes or bio text (save for your website)</li>
        <li>Special characters that may not display correctly</li>
        <li>Fax numbers (rarely used in modern networking)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Placement Best Practices -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Placement Best Practices</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Where you put your vCard QR code affects how easily people can scan it:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Business cards</strong> — Back of card is ideal; front works if there's room without crowding</li>
        <li><strong>Email signatures</strong> — Include at readable size (at least 100×100 pixels); link to a larger version</li>
        <li><strong>Presentations</strong> — Final slide with generous size so audience can scan from seats</li>
        <li><strong>Conference badges</strong> — Position where it won't be covered by lanyards or clothing</li>
        <li><strong>Printed materials</strong> — Flat surfaces scan better than curved; avoid folds across the code</li>
        <li><strong>Signage</strong> — Eye level works best; avoid placing too high or too low</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-4">Always consider lighting where the code will be used. Glossy surfaces create reflections that interfere with scanning—matte finishes work more reliably.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Testing Best Practices -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Testing Best Practices</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Never print a batch of business cards or finalize marketing materials without thorough testing:</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Multi-Device Testing</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Test with at least one iPhone and one Android device. Camera apps vary in QR reading capability—some older phones require dedicated scanner apps. If your audience includes international contacts, test with devices from different regions.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Condition Testing</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>Scan in bright light and dim indoor lighting</li>
        <li>Try different angles (straight-on and at 45 degrees)</li>
        <li>Test at the expected scanning distance</li>
        <li>Print a test copy on the actual paper stock you'll use</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Data Verification</h3>
      <p>After scanning, verify every field: Is your name spelled correctly? Is the phone number clickable? Does the email open a compose window? Does the website URL work? Catching errors before printing saves money and embarrassment.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Common Mistakes to Avoid -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Stretching the code</strong> — Always maintain a 1:1 aspect ratio; distorted codes fail to scan</li>
        <li><strong>Low resolution exports</strong> — Use 300 DPI minimum for print; avoid resizing in Word or PowerPoint</li>
        <li><strong>Placing on busy backgrounds</strong> — The quiet zone must be solid color, not patterned</li>
        <li><strong>Using decorative overlays</strong> — Logos in the center work with error correction; random decorations don't</li>
        <li><strong>Skipping the test scan</strong> — The most common mistake; always test before finalizing</li>
        <li><strong>Forgetting mobile format for phone numbers</strong> — Include country code (+1, +44, etc.) for international compatibility</li>
      </ul>
