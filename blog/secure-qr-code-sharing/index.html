      <!-- Introduction -->
      <section class="space-y-4">
        <p>In an era where data breaches make headlines weekly and identity theft affects millions, sharing your contact information requires careful consideration. QR codes have become the preferred method for exchanging business details—but convenience should never come at the cost of security. Every piece of personal data you embed in a QR code becomes accessible to anyone who scans it, making it essential to understand what you're sharing and with whom.</p>
        <p>This guide walks you through the security advantages of vCard QR codes, what information to include (and exclude), and proven strategies for protecting your privacy while networking effectively. Whether you're attending conferences, distributing digital business cards, or sharing contact details online, you'll learn how to do it safely.</p>

      <!-- How vCard QR Codes Protect Your Data -->
      <section class="space-y-4" id="protection">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900">How vCard QR Codes Protect Your Data</h2>
        <p>Unlike many digital services that store your information on remote servers, a properly designed <a href="/" class="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-500">vCard QR code generator</a> operates entirely within your browser. This client-side processing means your contact details never travel to an external server where they could be intercepted, stored, or sold to third parties.</p>
        <p>When you generate a vCard QR code on our platform, the encoding happens locally on your device using JavaScript. The resulting QR code contains your information in a standardized vCard format that phones can read directly—no database lookups, no cloud storage, no tracking. This approach eliminates the most common vulnerability in contact-sharing tools: centralized data storage that becomes a target for hackers.</p>
        <p>The vCard format itself is an open standard (defined by RFC 6350) that every smartphone understands. Because the data is self-contained within the QR pattern, your information works offline and remains under your complete control. You decide exactly what goes into the code, and once generated, no one can modify what's encoded without creating an entirely new QR code.</p>

      <section class="space-y-4" id="what-to-share">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900">What Information to Share Safely</h2>
        <p>The key to secure QR code sharing is distinguishing between your professional and personal identities. Business information is designed to be public—it's how people reach you in a professional context. Personal information, however, can be exploited for phishing, stalking, or identity theft when it falls into the wrong hands.</p>

      <!-- Privacy Best Practices -->
      <section class="space-y-4" id="best-practices">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900">Privacy Best Practices</h2>
        <p>Implementing a few strategic measures can dramatically reduce your exposure while maintaining full networking capability. These practices create layers of separation between your public professional presence and your private life.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3">
          <li><strong>Use a dedicated business email:</strong> Create an alias like contact@yourdomain.com or firstname@company.com. This keeps your personal inbox private and lets you filter or disable the address if spam becomes an issue.</li>
          <li><strong>Consider a virtual phone number:</strong> Services like Google Voice provide a separate number that forwards to your real phone. You can screen calls, block unwanted contacts, and change the number without affecting your personal line.</li>
          <li><strong>List your office address:</strong> If you work from home, use a coworking space address, PO Box, or simply omit the address entirely. Your city or region is usually sufficient for professional purposes.</li>
          <li><strong>Create context-specific codes:</strong> Generate different QR codes for different purposes. A conference badge might include more details than a code shared on social media. Learn more in our <a href="/blog/digital-business-card-strategies/" class="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-500">digital business card strategies</a> article.</li>
          <li><strong>Review before generating:</strong> Always preview your vCard data before creating the final QR code. Once printed on business cards or marketing materials, you cannot edit what's encoded.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Risks to Avoid -->
      <section class="space-y-4" id="risks">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900">Risks to Avoid</h2>
        <p>Understanding common mistakes helps you sidestep security pitfalls that could compromise your privacy or professional reputation.</p>
        <p><strong>Oversharing personal details:</strong> Every field you add to your vCard increases your exposure. Ask yourself: would I be comfortable if this information appeared on a billboard? If not, leave it out of your QR code.</p>
        <p><strong>Using your personal phone number:</strong> Once your mobile number is in circulation, it's nearly impossible to retract. Spam calls, phishing texts, and unwanted contacts become permanent problems. A business line provides a critical buffer.</p>
        <p><strong>Including your home address:</strong> This is perhaps the most dangerous piece of information to share publicly. It enables physical stalking and creates security risks for you and your family. Use business addresses exclusively.</p>
        <p><strong>Embedding sensitive identifiers:</strong> Never include social security numbers, government IDs, financial account numbers, or passwords in any QR code. This seems obvious, but some people mistakenly treat QR codes as private communication channels.</p>
        <p><strong>Ignoring code placement:</strong> QR codes on publicly displayed materials can be photographed by anyone. Consider whether the distribution context matches the sensitivity of the encoded information.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Secure Sharing Scenarios -->
      <section class="space-y-4" id="scenarios">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900">Secure Sharing Scenarios</h2>
        <p>Different contexts call for different approaches to contact sharing. Tailoring your strategy to the situation optimizes both security and effectiveness.</p>
        <p><strong>Networking events and conferences:</strong> In-person meetings provide built-in verification—you've met the person face-to-face. You can comfortably share a fuller vCard here, potentially including direct phone numbers. Display your QR code on your phone screen or badge for easy scanning.</p>
        <p><strong>Online and social media:</strong> When sharing QR codes digitally, assume anyone might scan them. Use minimal information: business email, website, and LinkedIn only. Our <a href="/blog/qr-code-and-vcard-guide/" class="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-500">complete vCard QR code guide</a> explains how to optimize codes for digital distribution.</p>
        <p><strong>Printed materials:</strong> Business cards, brochures, and signage have indefinite lifespans. Generate codes with this permanence in mind—information should remain appropriate and secure for years. Consider <a href="/logo-qr-code.html" class="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-500">adding your logo</a> to make the code visually authentic and harder to counterfeit.</p>
        <p><strong>Email signatures:</strong> These reach known contacts in professional contexts. A complete vCard works well here, making it easy for recipients to save your details while maintaining a professional appearance.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Verifying QR Code Authenticity -->
      <section class="space-y-4" id="verification">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900">Verifying QR Code Authenticity</h2>
        <p>Just as you should be thoughtful about what you share, recipients should verify QR codes before trusting them. Here's what to look for and what to advise your contacts.</p>
        <p><strong>Use native camera apps:</strong> Modern smartphones preview QR code destinations before opening them. This built-in security feature lets you see exactly what action will occur—whether it's adding a contact, opening a URL, or something else entirely.</p>
        <p><strong>Check for tampering:</strong> Physical QR codes can be covered with malicious stickers. Look for signs of overlay, such as raised edges or misaligned printing. If something looks off, don't scan it.</p>
        <p><strong>Verify the source:</strong> A QR code on an official business card or company website is more trustworthy than one on a random flyer or unsolicited email. Consider the context before scanning.</p>
        <p><strong>Inspect contact details:</strong> After scanning, review the vCard information before saving. Check that email domains match expected company addresses and phone numbers have appropriate area codes. Inconsistencies may indicate a spoofed code.</p>
