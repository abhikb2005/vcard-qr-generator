    <!-- What Is a Business Card QR Code Generator -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">What Is a Business Card QR Code Generator?</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">A business card QR code generator is a specialized tool that creates scannable codes containing your contact information in the vCard format. When printed on your business card, this QR code allows anyone with a smartphone to save your details instantly—no typing required.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">The technology works by encoding your name, phone number, email, company, and other contact details into a pattern that smartphones can read. Modern phones with iOS and Android have QR scanning built into their camera apps, making the process seamless for recipients.</p>
      <p>Unlike generic QR code tools, a dedicated business card QR code generator optimizes the output for the small space available on business cards while maintaining scannability. Our <a href="/" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline">free generator</a> creates <a href="/blog/vcard-qr-code/" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline">vCard QR codes</a> that work on any device and never expire.</p>

    <!-- Why Add a QR Code to Your Business Card -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why Add a QR Code to Your Business Card?</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Adding a QR code to your business card provides several advantages over traditional <a href="/blog/vcard-qr-code-vs-paper-business-cards/" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline">paper-only business cards</a>:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Instant contact saving</strong> — Recipients save your complete information in seconds rather than manually typing it later</li>
        <li><strong>Zero typos</strong> — Digital transfer eliminates errors when entering phone numbers or email addresses</li>
        <li><strong>Higher follow-up rates</strong> — Contacts saved immediately are more likely to be used than cards filed away</li>
        <li><strong>Modern impression</strong> — Shows you embrace technology and efficiency in your professional approach</li>
        <li><strong>Rich information</strong> — Include website links, social profiles, and detailed notes that wouldn't fit on a traditional card</li>
        <li><strong>Eco-friendly appeal</strong> — Reduces reliance on paper while maintaining personal connection</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Studies show that over 80% of paper business cards get discarded within a week. A QR code ensures your contact information makes it into phones where it's actually useful.</p>

    <!-- Design Considerations -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Design Considerations for Business Card QR Codes</h2>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Size and Dimensions</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">For business cards, size your QR code between 2cm and 3cm (0.8-1.2 inches) square. This provides reliable scanning while leaving room for your name, logo, and other card elements. Never go smaller than 2cm—tiny QR codes fail to scan reliably.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Color and Contrast</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li><strong>High contrast is essential</strong> — Dark modules on a light background scan best</li>
        <li><strong>Black on white works best</strong> — Other color combinations work if contrast is maintained</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid gradients</strong> — Solid colors ensure consistent scanning</li>
        <li><strong>Match your brand</strong> — Dark blue, green, or burgundy on white can complement your card design</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Quiet Zone</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Always maintain a white border (quiet zone) around your QR code—at least 4 modules wide. This margin helps smartphone cameras identify where the code begins and ends. Crowding other design elements too close causes scanning failures.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Adding Your Logo</h3>
      <p>Want to brand your QR code? Our <a href="/logo-qr-code.html" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline">logo QR code generator</a> lets you place your company logo in the center. Keep logos small (15-20% of the total QR area) so error correction can compensate for the covered modules.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Where to Place the QR Code -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Where to Place the QR Code on Your Card</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Strategic placement affects both aesthetics and scannability. For detailed printing specifications, see our <a href="/blog/contact-qr-code-printing-guide/" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline">QR code printing guide</a>.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Back of Card (Recommended)</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Placing the QR code on the back keeps your front design clean and professional. You can use a larger code (up to 3cm) since there's more space, and include a brief call-to-action like "Scan to save contact." This approach works well for traditional and minimalist card designs.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Front of Card</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">If you prefer front placement, position the QR code in a corner—typically bottom right. Keep it at 2cm to leave room for essential text elements. This placement works best for tech-forward brands where the QR code reinforces a modern image.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Printing Best Practices</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
        <li>Export your QR code at 300 DPI or higher for sharp printing</li>
        <li>Use matte or semi-gloss finishes—high gloss can cause glare that interferes with scanning</li>
        <li>Avoid textured or embossed areas over the QR code</li>
        <li>Test the printed card with multiple phones before ordering large quantities</li>
      </ul>

          <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">The back is more popular since it keeps the front clean for branding. However, front placement in a corner works well for tech-forward designs. Either location works if you maintain proper size and quiet zone.</p>

        <div class="p-4 bg-white rounded-lg border">
          <h3 class="font-semibold text-gray-900">Do business card QR codes expire?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">No. Static vCard QR codes never expire because the data is embedded in the code pattern itself. They work indefinitely without internet or subscriptions. Create a new code if your contact info changes.</p>
