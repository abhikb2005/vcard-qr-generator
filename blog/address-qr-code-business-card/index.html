          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Yes. Both iOS and Android devices can scan vCard QR codes and save the embedded address directly to the contacts app. Most phones also offer an option to open the address in their default maps application."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "For most professionals, a business address, PO box, or virtual office is safer than a home address. Only include a residential address if you operate a home-based business that welcomes walk-in clients."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Aim for at least 0.8 inches (20 mm) per side on printed cards. Smaller codes may work in ideal lighting but often fail in low-light conditions or when printed on textured paper."
