    <!-- Intro -->
    <section class="prose prose-indigo max-w-none">
      <p>When you hand someone a business card, you want them to remember you and, more importantly, find you. A phone number helps, but an address makes you tangible. Including your location in a QR code lets clients save your full street address to their phone's contacts with a single scan. From that moment on, they can tap the address to open navigation and drive straight to your door. For brick-and-mortar businesses, service providers, and anyone who meets clients in person, an address QR code business card bridges the gap between a quick introduction and a real-world visit.</p>

    <!-- What Is an Address QR Code Business Card? -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">What Is an Address QR Code Business Card?</h2>
      <p class="mb-3">An address QR code business card is a traditional printed card that includes a QR code encoded with vCard data containing your street address. The vCard format is an open standard recognized by virtually every smartphone, which means the recipient does not need a special app to use it.</p>
      <p class="mb-3">When someone scans the code, their phone parses the vCard and offers to save the contact. Because the address field is included, it appears alongside your name, phone number, and email in their contacts app. Many phones also detect that the address is a location and provide a shortcut to open it in Google Maps, Apple Maps, or their default navigation app. This turns a simple scan into a one-tap route to your office, store, or clinic.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- When to Include Your Address -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">When to Include Your Address</h2>
      <p class="mb-3">Not every professional needs an address on their business card, but many do. Consider adding your location if you operate a physical storefront where customers shop in person, such as a retail boutique, bakery, or repair shop. Service-area businesses like plumbers, electricians, and landscapers can include a warehouse or dispatch location to establish credibility without revealing a personal address.</p>
      <p class="mb-3">Real estate agents benefit from listing their brokerage office so buyers and sellers can meet in a professional setting. Medical and dental clinics, law firms, and accounting practices often rely on clients visiting an office, making the address a critical piece of contact information. Consultants who rent coworking desks or shared offices can include that address to appear more established. If you attend trade shows or networking events, a scannable address helps attendees remember where to find you long after the event ends. In short, any situation where clients might visit you in person is a situation where an address QR code adds value.</p>

    <!-- How to Create an Address QR Code for Your Card -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">How to Create an Address QR Code for Your Card</h2>
      <p class="mb-3">Creating an address QR code is straightforward with our <a href="/" class="text-indigo-600 underline hover:text-indigo-800">free vCard QR code generator</a>. Start by entering your name, phone number, and email as usual. Next, locate the address fields and fill in each component: street address, city, state or province, postal code, and country. Use the official postal format for your region to avoid confusion when the address is parsed by mapping software.</p>
      <p class="mb-3">If you have both a work address and a home address, enter each in its designated field. The vCard standard supports separate address types, so recipients can see both and choose the relevant one. Once all fields are complete, click Generate to create the QR code. Preview the result by scanning it with your own phone and verifying that the address appears correctly in the saved contact. Download the PNG at the highest resolution available, typically 1024 pixels or larger, to ensure print quality. For step-by-step formatting advice, see our <a href="/blog/qr-code-and-vcard-guide/" class="text-indigo-600 underline hover:text-indigo-800">complete vCard QR code guide</a>.</p>

    <!-- Address Privacy Considerations -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Address Privacy Considerations</h2>
      <p class="mb-3">Sharing your physical location comes with privacy implications. If you work from home but do not want clients showing up unannounced, avoid listing a residential address on a widely distributed business card. Instead, consider a PO box for mail, a virtual office that provides a professional street address, or a coworking space that allows mail handling.</p>
      <p class="mb-3">Freelancers and remote workers may prefer to omit the address entirely and rely on phone, email, or video calls. If you do include a home address—common for home-based salons, tutoring services, or cottage food businesses—make sure you are comfortable with clients knowing where you live. Think about who will receive your card and whether that audience warrants sharing your location. When in doubt, err on the side of caution and use a business-only address.</p>

    <!-- Design Tips for Address QR Codes -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Design Tips for Address QR Codes</h2>
      <p class="mb-3">Size matters. A QR code smaller than 0.8 inches (20 mm) per side may fail to scan, especially on matte or textured card stock. Position the code in a corner or along the bottom edge where it will not compete with your logo or headline. Maintain a quiet zone—an empty margin around the code—equal to at least four modules (the small squares that make up the code).</p>
      <p class="mb-3">Stick with high-contrast color combinations: dark codes on light backgrounds work best. If you want to add your logo, use our <a href="/logo-qr-code.html" class="text-indigo-600 underline hover:text-indigo-800">logo QR code generator</a> to embed it safely without breaking scannability. Before sending your design to the printer, test the final proof on multiple devices.

    <!-- Troubleshooting -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Troubleshooting</h2>
      <p class="mb-3"><strong>Address not showing in the saved contact:</strong> Double-check that you entered the address in the generator before creating the code. If the address field was left blank, the QR code will not contain location data. Regenerate the code with the address filled in.</p>
      <p class="mb-3"><strong>Maps app not opening:</strong> Some older phones or custom Android ROMs do not automatically link addresses to maps. The address is still saved in the contact—users can manually copy and paste it into their preferred navigation app.</p>
      <p class="mb-3"><strong>QR code not scanning:</strong> Ensure the printed code is large enough and has sufficient contrast. Avoid printing on glossy paper that causes glare. If the code still fails, regenerate it at a higher resolution and reprint.</p>
