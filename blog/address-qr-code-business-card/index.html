      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Direct navigation</strong> — Contacts can tap your address to open it in Google Maps or Apple Maps instantly</li>
        <li><strong>Professional credibility</strong> — A physical address adds legitimacy to your business presence</li>
        <li><strong>Complete contact record</strong> — All your information saves together, eliminating the need to look up your location separately</li>

    <!-- Address Formatting Best Practices -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Address Formatting Best Practices</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Proper address formatting ensures your location saves correctly and works with navigation apps:</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Standard Format</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Use this structure for best compatibility:</p>
      <div class="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg border mb-4 font-mono text-sm">
        123 Business Street, Suite 400<br>
        San Francisco, CA 94102<br>
        United States
      </div>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Formatting Tips</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Include suite/floor numbers</strong> — Help visitors find your exact location</li>
        <li><strong>Use standard abbreviations</strong> — CA, NY, TX (or full state names) both work</li>
        <li><strong>Add postal code</strong> — Essential for accurate navigation</li>
        <li><strong>Include country</strong> — Important if you network internationally</li>
        <li><strong>Spell out building names</strong> — "Empire State Building" is clearer than "ESB"</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">What to Avoid</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
        <li>Informal descriptions ("next to the coffee shop")</li>
        <li>Incomplete addresses missing postal codes</li>
        <li>Multiple addresses (increases code density)</li>
        <li>Special characters that might cause encoding issues</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Privacy Considerations -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Privacy Considerations for Address QR Codes</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Before adding your address to a business card QR code, consider who will receive your card and what address is appropriate:</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Use Business Address, Not Home</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">If you work from home, avoid putting your residential address on publicly distributed business cards. Alternatives include:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>P.O. Box for mail correspondence</li>
        <li>Coworking space address</li>
        <li>Virtual office address</li>
        <li>Omit address entirely if not needed</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Create Different Cards for Different Contexts</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Consider having multiple QR code versions:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Public networking card</strong> — Phone, email, website only</li>
        <li><strong>Client card</strong> — Full contact including office address</li>
        <li><strong>Internal card</strong> — Complete details for colleagues</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Our generator is free and instant, so creating multiple versions takes just minutes. For more privacy guidance, see our <a href="/blog/secure-qr-code-sharing/" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline">secure QR code sharing</a> guide.</p>

    <!-- QR Code Size Considerations -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">How Address Data Affects QR Code Size</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Every field you add to your vCard increases the QR code's data density. More data means a more complex pattern that can be slightly harder to scan:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Name + phone + email</strong> — Minimal density, scans easily at 2cm</li>
        <li><strong>Above + company + title</strong> — Light density, 2cm still works</li>
        <li><strong>Above + full address</strong> — Moderate density, use 2.5-3cm for reliability</li>
        <li><strong>Above + website + notes</strong> — Higher density, may need 3cm+</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-4">For business cards with address data, size your QR code at <strong>2.5cm minimum</strong> to ensure reliable scanning. Test with multiple phones before printing.</p>
      <p>See our <a href="/blog/contact-qr-code-printing-guide/" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline">printing guide</a> for detailed sizing recommendations.</p>
