    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Creating a QR code is the easy part—getting it to scan reliably once it's printed is where many people struggle. Whether you're adding a contact QR code to business cards, brochures, event badges, or promotional materials, the transition from screen to paper introduces variables that can make or break your code's functionality. This comprehensive printing guide covers everything you need to know about resolution, sizing, file formats, paper selection, and pre-print testing to ensure your <a href="/blog/qr-code-and-vcard-guide/" class="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-800 underline">vCard QR code</a> works perfectly every time someone scans it.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Print Resolution Requirements -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Print Resolution Requirements</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Resolution is the foundation of print quality. For QR codes, you need a minimum of 300 DPI (dots per inch) to ensure each module—the small squares that make up the code—prints with crisp, defined edges. At lower resolutions, these modules become blurry, and the boundaries between black and white areas lose definition. When a smartphone camera tries to decode a low-resolution QR code, it may struggle to distinguish individual modules, leading to slow scans or complete failures.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Professional print shops typically work at 300-600 DPI, which is ideal for QR codes. When exporting your code from our <a href="/" class="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-800 underline">free vCard QR generator</a>, choose the highest resolution option available. If you're printing large-format materials like banners or posters, you can sometimes get away with 150 DPI since viewers scan from greater distances—but for business cards and close-range materials, never go below 300 DPI. The extra file size is worth the reliability.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Minimum Size Guidelines -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Minimum Size Guidelines</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">The absolute minimum size for a printed QR code is 2cm x 2cm (approximately 0.8 inches). At this size, most smartphone cameras can decode the pattern when held 10-15cm away. However, this minimum assumes ideal conditions—good lighting, steady hands, and a high-quality print. For real-world reliability, aim for 2.5-3cm whenever space allows.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Scaling rules matter too. If users will scan from arm's length (about 30cm), increase to at least 3cm. For signage viewed from a meter away, you'll need 5cm or larger. A useful formula: the scanning distance in centimeters divided by 10 gives you the approximate minimum QR code size. When designing your <a href="/blog/business-card-qr-code-generator/" class="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-800 underline">business card QR code</a>, balance size with the other design elements while staying above that 2cm floor.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- File Format for Printing -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">File Format for Printing</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">PNG and SVG are the two primary formats for print-ready QR codes, and each serves different purposes. PNG files are raster images—they're made of pixels and have a fixed resolution. Export PNGs at 300 DPI or higher, matched to your intended print size. A QR code that will print at 3cm should be exported at least 354 pixels wide (3cm at 300 DPI = 354 pixels).</p>
      <p class="mb-4">SVG files are vector graphics that scale infinitely without quality loss. They're ideal when you're unsure of the final print size or when creating templates for multiple uses. Print shops can scale an SVG to any dimension—from a tiny label to a billboard—and it remains perfectly sharp. Use SVG for <a href="/logo-qr-code.html" class="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-800 underline">logo QR codes</a> destined for professional printing, and PNG for quick office prints or digital sharing.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Paper and Finish Considerations -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Paper and Finish Considerations</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Paper choice significantly impacts scannability. Matte finishes are the safest option—they eliminate glare and provide consistent scanning under any lighting condition. Satin finishes offer a slight sheen while still minimizing reflections. Glossy paper, while visually striking, creates hot spots under direct light that can blind smartphone cameras and prevent successful scans.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Cardstock weight matters for durability. Standard 300-350gsm cardstock works well for business cards and holds up to handling without warping. For outdoor use or high-touch applications, consider laminated cards with a matte laminate overlay. Avoid highly textured papers like linen or laid finishes—the surface irregularities can create shadows that interfere with scanning. If brand guidelines require glossy materials, test extensively under office lighting, outdoor sunlight, and camera flash conditions before committing to a large print run.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- The Quiet Zone -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">The Quiet Zone</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">The quiet zone is the white (or light-colored) border surrounding your QR code, and it's not optional. This margin helps scanning apps distinguish where the code ends and the background begins. The standard requirement is a quiet zone equal to at least four modules wide—roughly 10% of the total QR code dimension on each side.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">When placing QR codes in designs, don't crowd other elements against the edge. Text, images, or decorative borders that encroach on the quiet zone cause scanning failures. Following <a href="/blog/vcard-qr-code-best-practices/" class="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-800 underline">vCard QR code best practices</a> means treating the quiet zone as sacred space. If your design requires a colored background, ensure the quiet zone matches the code's light modules—typically white or very light gray.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Pre-Print Testing Checklist -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Pre-Print Testing Checklist</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Before sending any QR code to a commercial printer, complete this verification process. First, test the digital file on at least three devices: an iPhone, an Android phone, and a tablet. Different camera qualities and scanning apps behave differently, so broad device coverage catches edge cases.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Request a physical proof from your printer. Digital proofs on screens don't reveal print-specific issues like ink bleed, registration errors, or color shifts. Scan the proof under multiple lighting conditions—fluorescent office lights, natural daylight, and dim indoor settings. Verify that the encoded contact data is correct by checking the saved contact after scanning. Finally, have someone unfamiliar with the code test it—fresh eyes catch problems you might overlook. This ten-minute investment prevents expensive reprints.</p>

    <!-- Common Printing Mistakes -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Common Printing Mistakes</h2>
      <p class="mb-4"><strong>Too small:</strong> Codes under 2cm frequently fail. When in doubt, go bigger. <strong>Low resolution:</strong> Blurry modules from 72 DPI web exports don't scan reliably—always use 300 DPI minimum. <strong>Aspect ratio distortion:</strong> Stretching or squishing a QR code breaks the mathematical patterns scanners rely on. Always scale proportionally.</p>
      <p class="mb-4"><strong>Poor contrast:</strong> Light gray on white or dark blue on black doesn't provide enough contrast. Stick to black modules on white backgrounds for guaranteed compatibility. <strong>Inverted colors:</strong> White modules on dark backgrounds can work but require testing—many older phones struggle with inverted codes. <strong>Missing quiet zone:</strong> Trimming the border to fit a tight layout saves space but kills functionality. These mistakes are easily avoided with proper preparation.</p>
