    <!-- What Is a Contactless Business Card QR Code -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">What Is a Contactless Business Card QR Code?</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">A contactless business card QR code is a scannable code that contains your professional contact information in digital form. When someone scans the code with their smartphone camera, your details—name, phone, email, company—are instantly offered for saving to their address book.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">The "contactless" aspect means there's no physical exchange required. You can display your QR code on a phone screen, a name badge, a poster, or any surface that people can scan from a safe distance. This makes it ideal for health-conscious networking, busy events, and situations where handing out paper cards isn't practical.</p>
      <p>Unlike NFC (tap-to-share) technology, QR codes work with any smartphone—no special hardware or compatible devices needed. Every modern iPhone and Android phone can scan QR codes natively through their camera app.</p>

    <!-- Ways to Display Your Contactless Card -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Ways to Display Your Contactless QR Code</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">The beauty of contactless QR codes is their flexibility. Here are the most effective display options:</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Phone Screen Display</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">The simplest approach: save your QR code image to your phone's photos or home screen. When networking, show your screen and let people scan directly. This works anywhere and requires nothing extra to carry.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Name Badge or Lanyard</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Print your QR code on your conference badge or attach a card to your lanyard. This leaves your hands free and lets people scan without interrupting your conversation. Size it at 2.5-3cm for reliable scanning.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Trade Show Booth Display</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Place a large QR code (15-20cm) on your booth backdrop or table display. Visitors can scan from several feet away, capturing your team's contact info without waiting in line.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Presentation Slides</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Add your contactless QR code to your closing slide when presenting. Audience members can scan and save your contact as they leave, making follow-up effortless.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Hybrid Physical Cards</h3>
      <p>Print QR codes on traditional business cards as a backup option. Recipients can scan immediately or keep the card for later—the best of both worlds. See our <a href="/blog/contact-qr-code-printing-guide/" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline">printing guide</a> for sizing tips.</p>

    <!-- Best Practices -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Best Practices for Contactless QR Cards</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Keep it scannable</strong> — Maintain high contrast (dark code on light background) and adequate size (minimum 2cm)</li>
        <li><strong>Include essential info only</strong> — Name, phone, email, and company are usually sufficient. Too much data creates dense codes</li>
        <li><strong>Test on multiple devices</strong> — Verify your code works on both iPhone and Android before events</li>
        <li><strong>Add a call-to-action</strong> — Include text like "Scan to save my contact" near the QR code</li>
        <li><strong>Position at eye level</strong> — Whether on a badge or booth display, make it easy to scan</li>
        <li><strong>Keep your phone charged</strong> — If displaying on screen, ensure your phone stays powered throughout events</li>
      </ul>
