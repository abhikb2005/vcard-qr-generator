      <p class="text-xl text-slate-800">Replacing a stack of paper cards with a QR-driven workflow keeps your contact details at the center of every conversation. These strategies help you stay memorable long after the event wraps.</p>
      <section class="space-y-4">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900">Plan your digital introduction</h2>
        <p>Craft a short personal narrative that pairs with your QR code. When someone scans it, the story on the vCard should match the pitch they just heard from you.</p>
        <p>Use consistent headshots, color palettes, and tone across your QR code, website, and follow-up emails to build trust quickly.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2"><li>Keep your elevator pitch to two or three sentences</li><li>Highlight a problem you solve rather than a list of titles</li><li>Update your headshot yearly so it matches in-person meetings</li></ul>
      </section>
<section class="space-y-4">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900">Engage during the event</h2>
        <p>Place the QR code where it is easy to scanâ€”lanyards, tabletop signage, and presentation slides are all prime real estate.</p>
        <p>Offer a quick incentive after the scan, such as a checklist or cheat sheet. A tiny piece of value can secure a spot in a prospect's memory.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2"><li>Use large enough QR codes for people standing a few feet away</li><li>Bring backup cards in case of low connectivity</li><li>Encourage a mutual exchange: scan their code right back</li></ul>
      </section>
<section class="space-y-4">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900">Follow through with intention</h2>
        <p>Within a day of each event, send a personal note that references your conversation. Include a link back to your QR code landing page so they can save your details again if needed.</p>
        <p>Track which outreach messages get responses. Refine your template to keep future follow-ups succinct and helpful.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2"><li>Automate reminders in your CRM or calendar</li><li>Segment contacts by event to personalize your messaging</li><li>Add a second touchpoint a week later if you do not hear back</li></ul>
