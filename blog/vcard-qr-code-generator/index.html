      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">A vCard QR code generator transforms your contact information into a scannable QR code that anyone can use to instantly save your details to their phone. Instead of exchanging paper business cards that get lost or manually typing contact information, a simple scan adds your name, phone number, email, and more directly to their address book. Whether you're networking at conferences, meeting potential clients, or sharing your professional details online, a <a href="/blog/vcard-qr-code/" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline">vCard QR code</a> makes the process seamless. Our free generator creates these codes in seconds, right in your browser, with no signup or software installation required.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">What Is a vCard QR Code Generator?</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">A vCard QR code generator is an online tool that converts your contact details into a standardized vCard format and encodes them into a QR code image. You enter information like your name, phone number, email address, and company details into a form, and the generator produces a downloadable QR code image. When someone scans this code with their smartphone camera, their device recognizes the vCard data and offers to save it as a new contact. Our browser-based generator handles all the encoding locally on your device using JavaScript, meaning your personal information never gets uploaded to any server. The output is a high-resolution PNG file ready for digital sharing or professional printing.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">Why Use Our Free Generator</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Our vCard QR code generator stands out from alternatives because it respects your time and privacy. There's no account creation, no email verification, and no payment information required—just open the page and start creating. Unlike many online tools that process your data on remote servers, our generator works entirely client-side. The JavaScript runs in your browser, encoding your contact information locally without any network requests. This means your personal details, phone numbers, and email addresses never leave your device.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The generator produces results instantly—enter your information, click generate, and your QR code appears immediately. There are no usage limits or daily caps, so you can create as many codes as you need for different business cards, email signatures, or marketing materials. For users who want additional branding options, our <a href="/logo-qr-code.html" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline">Pro version</a> lets you add a custom logo to the center of your QR code while maintaining the same privacy-first approach.</p>

    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">What Information Can You Include</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The vCard format supports a comprehensive set of contact fields that cover both personal and professional networking needs. You can include your full name (first and last), multiple phone numbers (work, mobile, home), and email addresses. Business professionals can add their company name and job title to establish credibility. For complete contact profiles, include your website URL so connections can explore your work, and your physical address if relevant for local business relationships. The generator handles all supported fields gracefully—leave any field blank if it doesn't apply to you, and the QR code will only encode the information you provide. Learn more about the <a href="/blog/qr-code-and-vcard-guide/" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline">complete vCard format specifications</a> in our detailed guide.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">Step-by-Step Guide to Creating Your vCard QR Code</h2>
      <div class="space-y-3">
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-gray-900">Step 1: Open the Generator</strong><br>Navigate to our <a href="/" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline">home page</a> where you'll find the vCard QR code generator form ready to use. No login or setup required.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-gray-900">Step 2: Enter Your Contact Details</strong><br>Fill in the form fields with your information. Start with your name, then add your phone number and email address. Include your company name and job title if you're creating a professional business card code.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-gray-900">Step 3: Add Optional Information</strong><br>Expand your contact profile by adding your website URL and physical address. These fields are optional but help create a more complete digital business card.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-gray-900">Step 4: Generate the QR Code</strong><br>Click the Generate button. The generator processes your information locally and displays your QR code instantly on screen.</p>

    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">After You Generate Your QR Code</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Once you've downloaded your vCard QR code, test it thoroughly before distributing. Scan with multiple devices—both iPhone and Android—to confirm universal compatibility. When printing on business cards or marketing materials, maintain a minimum size of 2cm × 2cm and ensure adequate quiet zone (white space) around the code for reliable scanning. For digital use, add the QR code to your email signature, LinkedIn profile, or personal website. If you're embedding in PDFs or presentations, use the original PNG file without resizing to preserve scan quality. Keep your master PNG file saved safely—if your contact details change, you'll need to generate a new code and replace it everywhere you've used the old one.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">Upgrading to Branded QR Codes</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">While our free generator creates perfectly functional vCard QR codes, professionals often want their codes to reflect their brand identity. Our <a href="/logo-qr-code.html" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline">Pro version with logo support</a> lets you embed your company logo or professional headshot in the center of the QR code. This creates a distinctive, branded appearance that increases recognition and makes your business card stand out. The logo feature uses error correction to ensure the code remains scannable even with the center image.
