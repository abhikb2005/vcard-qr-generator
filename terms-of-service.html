                <p>Welcome to vCard QR Code Generator! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of our website and services. By accessing or using our services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

                <h2>1. Services Provided</h2>
                <p>vCard QR Code Generator provides a free tool for creating vCard QR codes. We also offer paid "Pro" features, such as adding a logo to the QR code, which are accessible via a one-time payment.</p>

                <h2>2. Payments</h2>
                <p>Payments for Pro features are processed through our third-party payment processor, Stripe. By making a purchase, you agree to abide by the payment processor's terms of service. All prices are listed in USD or the equivalent in your local currency as determined by the payment processor.</p>
                
                <h2>3. Cancellation and Refund Policy</h2>
                <p>This section outlines our policy regarding cancellations and refunds, in compliance with Indian consumer protection laws.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Nature of Service:</strong> Our paid service is a one-time purchase that grants immediate access to a digital tool (`pro-generator.html`). The service is considered delivered in full at the moment of successful payment and redirection to the Pro tool page.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Cancellation:</strong> As the service is a one-time digital purchase delivered instantly, there is no recurring subscription to cancel.</li>
                    <li><strong>Refund Policy:</strong> Due to the instant-access nature of our digital service, **all sales are final and non-refundable.** We do not offer refunds once a purchase is completed and the user has been granted access to the Pro features.</li>
                    <li><strong>Exceptional Circumstances:</strong> In the rare event of a technical failure where you pay but do not get redirected or cannot access the Pro tool, please contact our customer support at `contact@vcardqrcodegenerator.com` within 48 hours of your purchase. We will investigate the issue and, if a verifiable technical fault on our end is found, we will manually grant you access to the tool. Monetary refunds will not be issued.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>
                <p>You are responsible for the accuracy of the information you provide for vCard generation. You agree not to use our service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose.</p>

                <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>Our service is provided "as is." We are not liable for any damages or losses resulting from your use of our service, including any errors in the generated QR codes.</p>

                <h2>6. Changes to Terms</h2>
                <p>We may modify these Terms at any time. We will notify users of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page.</p>
